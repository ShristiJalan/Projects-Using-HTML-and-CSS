            What is snow?
            Snow cover is a part of the cryosphere, which traces its origins to the Greek word kryos for frost. Snow is
            precipitation in the form of ice crystals. It originates in clouds when temperatures are below the freezing
            point (0 degrees Celsius, or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses directly
            into
            ice without going through the liquid stage. Once an ice crystal has formed, it absorbs and freezes
            additional
            water vapor from the surrounding air, growing into a snow crystal or snow pellet, which then falls to Earth.

            Snow falls in several forms:

            Snowflakes are clusters of ice crystals that fall from a cloud.
            Snow pellets, or graupel, are opaque ice particles in the atmosphere. They form as ice crystals fall through
            supercooled cloud droplets, which are below freezing but remain a liquid. The cloud droplets then freeze to
            the
            crystals, forming a lumpy mass. Graupel tends to be soft and crumbly.
            Sleet is composed of drops of rain or drizzle that freeze into ice as they fall, and is sometimes called a
            wintery mix of rain and snow. These small, translucent balls of ice are usually smaller than 0.76
            centimeters
            (0.30 inches) in diameter. Official weather observations may list sleet as ice pellets. In some parts of the
            United States, the term sleet can refer to a mixture of ice pellets and freezing rain.
            One form of precipitation, hail, while frozen, is not considered snow. Hail tends to be larger than sleet,
            and
            is usually generated during thunderstorms, which happen more often in spring and summer than in winter.
            Hailstones form when upward moving air, or updrafts, in a thunderstorm prevent pieces of graupel from
            falling.
            Drops of supercooled water hit the graupel and freeze to it, causing the graupel to grow. When the balls of
            ice
            become too heavy for the updrafts to continue supporting them, they fall as hailstones.
            Snow as mineral
            Because snow is composed of frozen water, or ice, it can also be classified as a mineral. A mineral is a
            naturally occurring homogeneous solid, inorganically formed, with a definite chemical composition and an
            ordered
            atomic arrangement. Ice is naturally occurring, given a temperature below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees
            Fahrenheit). It is homogenous (of one material), formed inorganically, and has an ordered atomic structure.
            Ice
            has a definite chemical composition (H20), with hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonding in a specific manner.
            A cold front, the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsquallsâ€”an intense frontal
            convective line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong
            convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which line passes over
            as the wind causes intense blowing snow.[7] This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at
            any point along its path but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a
            short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening
            low-pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In
            situations where squalls develop post-frontally it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands
            pass in rapid succession only separated by 25 miles (40 kilometers) with each passing the same point in
            roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing the squall
            may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.
